				<p>
					On my free time, I like to play instruments. 
					I usually play the guitar but my favorite would 
					be the bass. It is low and groovy just like me. 
					I also love to mingle with multimedia. 
					I am also a junior layout artist from the Guilds.
					I consider my hobbies as my skills also. The love that I have for my hobbies helped me to grow
					as a person. It helped me gain creative advantages that gained me edge in everything I do. 
					I have always dreamt to have a family. I have always imagined myself with kids that I can teach my
					skills and hobbies to.
